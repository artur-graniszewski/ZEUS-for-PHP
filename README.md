# Introduction

![ZEUS for PHP logo](http://php.webtutor.pl/zeus/zeus-logo-small.png)

**ZEUS for PHP** is an event-driven, preemptive _Multitasking Runtime Environment_ and _Service Management System_ integrated with Zend Framework 3. It's main purpose is to perform multiple tasks (processes) concurrently.

To guarantee true parallelism and resource isolation ZEUS employs preemptive schedulers and an Inter-Process Communication mechanism to allow its processes to share the data.

***ZEUS for PHP is not a standalone service, in order to use it, it must be installed as a module on-top of any Zend Framework application!.***

It's designed to be compliant with any ZF3 application such as Apigility or ZendSkeleton. Custom applications must provide index.php file which starts the Zend Framework MVC `Application` class.

# Sample usage

## Supported command line options

Since version 1.3.5, the following commands are supported (assuming that Zend Framework's `index.php` application bootstrap file is compatible with Zend Framework 3 `MVC` Module):

* `index.php zeus start` - Starts all ZEUS Server Services
* `index.php zeus start <service-name>` - Starts selected Server Service
* `index.php zeus list` - Lists all Server Services and their configuration
* `index.php zeus list <service-name>` - Shows the configuration of a selected Server Service
* `index.php zeus status` - Returns current status of all Server Services
* `index.php zeus status <service-name>` - Returns current status of the selected Server Service
* `index.php zeus stop` - Stops all ZEUS Server Services
* `index.php zeus stop <service-name>` - Stops selected Server Service

## Starting built-in Web Server

Command:
```
user@host:/var/www/zf-application/public$ php index.php zeus start zeus_httpd
```

## Executing functions asynchronously in ZF3 controllers

First, the Async Server Service must be launched in order to execute anonymous functions.

Command:
```
user@host:/var/www/zf-application/public$ php index.php zeus status zeus_httpd
```

The following ZF3 Application code can be handled by any HTTP Server, such as Apache HTTPD or Nginx - such functions are serialized and send to Async Server Service for asynchronous execution.

```php
<?php 
// contents of "zf3-application-directory/module/SomeModule/src/Controller/SomeController.php" file:

namespace Application\Controller;

use Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractActionController;
use Zend\View\Model\ViewModel;
use ZF\Apigility\Admin\Module as AdminModule;

class IndexController extends AbstractActionController
{
    public function indexAction()
    {
        for ($i = 0; $i < 12; $i++) {
            // each run() command immediately starts one task in the background and returns a handle ID
            $handles[$i] = $this->async()->run(function () use ($i) {
                sleep($i);
                return "OK $i";
            });
        }

        // join() accepts either an array of handle IDs or a single handle ID (without array)
        // - in case of array of handles, join will return an array of results,
        // - in case of a single handler, join will return a single result (not wrapped into the array)
        $results = $this->async()->join($handles);

        // because of the sleep(11) executed in a last callback, join() command will wait up to 11 seconds to fetch
        // results from all the handles, on success $result variable will contain the following data:
        // ["OK0","OK1","OK2","OK3","OK4","OK5","OK6","OK7","OK8","OK9","OK10","OK11"]

        // please keep in mind that each handle can be joined independently and join() blocks until the slowest
        // callback returns the data, therefore running $this->async()->join($handles[3]) command instead
        // would block this controller only for 3 seconds

        // usual Zend Framework stuff to return data to the view layer
        $view = new ViewModel();
        $view->setVariable('async_results', $results);
    }
}
```

## Building HTML documentation

Please note, *mkdocs* must be installed first using the `apt-get` command, or any other OS-specific package-manager.

Command:
```
user@host:/var/www/zf-application/vendor/zeus-server/zf3-server$ make doc-server
```

## Serving markdown documentation

Command:
```
user@host:/var/www/zf-application/vendor/zeus-server/zf3-server$ make doc-build
```

After executing above command, ZEUS documentation can be found under the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

# Requirements

## OS requirements
- Linux/Unix/BSD platform
- _Windows platform currently not supported_

## PHP requirements
- PHP 5.6+ (HHVM or PHP 7+ is recommended for performance reasons as ZEUS can be up to 4x faster and use less memory)
- Posix module installed and enabled
- Pcntl module installed and enabled
- socket functions enabled for IPC purposes

## Library requirements
- Zend Framework 3+ application (with the following modules installed: `zend-mvc`, `zend-mvc-console`, `zend-console`, `zend-log`, `zend-config`)
- Opis library (`opis/closure`)
- ReactPHP library

# Installation

ZEUS for PHP can be installed in two different ways:

## Downloading

### via Composer: 

```
user@host:/var/www/$ cd zf3-application-directory
user@host:/var/www/zf3-application-directory$ composer require zeus-server/zf3-server
```

### by downloading source code

Source codes can be found in ZIP file under the following URL: https://github.com/artur-graniszewski/ZEUS-for-PHP/archive/master.zip

After downloading, contents of the compressed `ZEUS-for-PHP-master` directory in ZIP file must be unpacked into a ZF3 `zf3-application-directory/module/Zeus` directory.

## Enabling ZEUS module

After installation, ZEUS for PHP must be activated in Zend Framework's `config/modules.config.php` file, like so:

```php
<?php 
// contents of "zf3-application-directory/config/modules.config.php" file:

return [
    'Zend\\Log',
    'Zend\\Mvc\\Console',
    '...',
    'Zeus' // this line should be added
];
```

This can be achieved either by modifying configuration file in any text editor, or by issuing `sed` command in Application's root directory:
```
user@host:/var/www/zf3-application-directory$ sed -i "s/'Zend\\\Log',/'Zend\\\Log','Zeus',/g" config/modules.config.php
```

If ZEUS for PHP is installed correctly, the following terminal command will show ZEUS version and its services in console:

```
user@host:/var/www/zf-application/public$ php index.php zeus status zeus_httpd
```
