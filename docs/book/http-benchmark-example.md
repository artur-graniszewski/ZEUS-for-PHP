# Prerequisites

The tests below assume that ZEUS is installed on top of the Apigility application (see "Integration with Apigility" section for details).

Also, make sure that Apache Benchmark tool is installed. 

# Static files test

## Throughput test

Open another terminal instance (ZEUS should be running in the first terminal)

We will test performance of 16 concurrent OPTIONS requests (the `-c 16 -i` switches) using the keep-alive connections (`-k` switch).

Command:
```
user@host:/var/www/zf-apigility-skeleton$ ab -n 50000 -c 16 -k -i http://127.0.0.1:7070/apigility-ui/img/ag-hero.png
```

Output (on the _Intel Core i7_ processor):

In this test, ZEUS Web Server served over **17,918** requests per second.

## Bandwidth test

First, we will create a 1MB static file in `public` directory of the Zend Framework 3 application.

Command:
```
user@host:/var/www/zf-apigility-skeleton$ dd if=/dev/zero of=public/test.file.txt bs=1 count=1 seek=1048575
```

Now, we lets test the performance of 16 concurrent GET requests (the `-c 16` switches) using the keep-alive connections (`-k` switch) on a newly generated static file.

Command:
```
user@host:/var/www/zf-apigility-skeleton$ ab -n 50000 -c 16 -k http://127.0.0.1:7070/test.file.txt
```

Output (on the _Intel Core i7_ processor with a _7200RPM HDD_):

In this test setup, ZEUS Web Server sent *50* gigabytes of data, achieving a speed of around **980** megabytes, or **8085** megabits (8 Gbits) per second.

# Athletic tests

ZEUS comes equipped with scripts for benchmarking its HTTP Service using the Athletic framework; these tests can be found in the `benchmarks/Http` directory.

To execute the benchmarks the following command must be issued:

```
user@host:/var/www/zf-apigility-skeleton/vendor/zeus-server/zf3-server$ ../../bin/athletic -p benchmarks/Http
```

Output (on the _Intel Core i7_ processor):
